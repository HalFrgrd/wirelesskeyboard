## LEDs
Single LED:

With no resistor, the LED would burn out quickly.

Calculating the resistor value: $R = \frac{V_{source}-V_{LED}}{I_{LED}}$.

## Joysticks
- 4 / 5 lines
- 5 if we are using it as a button as well
- VCC, GND, X, Y
- X, Y need to go to analog pins.

## Rotary encoder
The encoder generates two offset square wave outputs. Measuring both of them can tell us the direction and speed we are rotating.

Encoders rotate around continuously but potentiometers only rotate one revolution.
