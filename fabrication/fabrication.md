# Fabrication resources

## [Creating Sparkfun Artemis](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/3122)
Talks about manufacturing PCBs for a very small BGA component.

## Wiring
### Enameled wire
Enameled copper wire (aka magent wire) has a very thin layer of insulation. 
The insulation burns off when soldering.
Not having to deal with stripping the insulation speeds up wiring.

### Rigid wiring
- [Looks pretty neat](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=95382.0). Jewelry wire is widely available.

## Soldering
### Flux

Often in solder.

### To solder underside pads:
Create pads at the top and have vias in the pads. 
Put 0.1mm wire through the vias. 
Maybe this will resolve some issues of
