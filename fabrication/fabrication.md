Talks about manufacturing PCBs for a very small BGA component.

## Wiring
### Enameled wire
Enameled copper wire (aka magent wire) has a very thin layer of insulation. 
The insulation burns off when soldering.
Not having to deal with stripping the insulation speeds up wiring.

### Rigid wiring

## Soldering
### Flux

Often in solder.
